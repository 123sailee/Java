Here are the JQL queries for each scenario:  

**17. Find all Jira issues assigned to you with the status "In Progress":**  
```JQL
assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"
```

**18. Find all issues in the current sprint that are still open:**  
```JQL
sprint in openSprints() AND statusCategory != Done
```

**19. Find all issues with the label “Bug” that were created in the last 7 days:**  
```JQL
labels = "Bug" AND created >= -7d
```

**20. Find all issues assigned to you, excluding those with the status "Done":**  
```JQL
assignee = currentUser() AND status != "Done"
```
