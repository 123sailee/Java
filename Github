### 2. **Git Commit and Push**  
If you have modified multiple files and want to stage, commit, and push them to GitHub:

```sh
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Updated multiple files with necessary changes"

# Push to the remote repository (main branch)
git push origin main
```

*If you're using a different branch, replace `main` with the correct branch name.*

### 3. **JQL Query to Find Bugs Created in the Last 7 Days**  
To find all Jira issues with the label **"Bug"** that were created in the last 7 days, use this JQL query:

```jql
project = "<Project_Name>" AND labels = Bug AND created >= -7d
```

- Replace `<Project_Name>` with the actual project name or key.
- `created >= -7d` filters issues created in the last 7 days.

Let me know if you need further details!
