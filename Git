Hereâ€™s how you can handle each of these Git tasks on your Ubuntu machine:

21. Install Git and Configure GitHub Account
Install Git
Open a terminal and run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
Verify Installation
Check if Git is installed correctly:

git --version
Configure Git with Your GitHub Username and Email

git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
Check Configuration

git config --global --list
Generate SSH Key (Optional but Recommended for Authentication)

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
Press Enter to save the key in the default location.
Copy the key to GitHub:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to GitHub SSH settings, click New SSH Key, and paste the key.
22. Update Git User Email
If you need to update the email for future commits:

git config --global user.email "new-email@example.com"
To update the email for a specific repository:

git config --local user.email "new-email@example.com"
23. Initialize a Git Repository and Link to GitHub
Navigate to the project folder:
cd /path/to/your/project
Initialize Git:
git init
Add a README file (optional but recommended):
echo "# MyProject" >> README.md
Stage and commit the initial files:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Link the repository to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepoName.git
Push the repository to GitHub:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
24. Create a New Branch, Switch to It, and Push to GitHub
Create a new branch:
git branch feature-branch
Switch to the new branch:
git checkout feature-branch
OR (shortcut)
git checkout -b feature-branch
Push the branch to GitHub:
git push -u origin feature-branch
25. Create a New Branch, Work on It, and Merge It Back
Create and switch to the new branch:
git checkout -b new-feature
Make changes and commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
Switch back to the main branch:
git checkout main
Merge the feature branch into the main branch:
git merge new-feature
Push the updated main branch to GitHub:
git push origin main
26. Start a Hotfix While Another Feature Branch is in Progress
Ensure you are on the main branch:
git checkout main
Create a hotfix branch:
git checkout -b hotfix-issue
Apply changes, commit, and merge into the main branch:
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed critical bug"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix-issue
Push the hotfix changes to GitHub:
git push origin main
Switch back to the original feature branch (if needed):
git checkout feature-branch

Hereâ€™s how to handle these Git tasks efficiently on Ubuntu:

27. Stage All Changes, Commit, and Push to GitHub
If you've modified multiple files and want to stage everything, commit, and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin branch-name
git add . â†’ Stages all changes.
git commit -m "Your commit message" â†’ Commits with a message.
git push origin branch-name â†’ Pushes the changes to GitHub.
28. Stage Only Specific Files, Commit, and Push
If you've modified specific files and only want to stage those:

git add file1.txt file2.txt
git commit -m "Updated file1 and file2"
git push origin branch-name
git add file1.txt file2.txt â†’ Stages only the selected files.
git commit -m "Updated file1 and file2" â†’ Commits with a message.
git push origin branch-name â†’ Pushes to GitHub.
29. Add and Commit Changes to a File
If you've made changes but havenâ€™t staged or committed them:

git add filename.txt
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git add filename.txt â†’ Stages the file.
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message" â†’ Commits the change.
30. Merge a Feature Branch into Main Smoothly
To merge your feature branch into main:

Ensure youâ€™re on the main branch:
git checkout main
Pull the latest changes (to avoid conflicts):
git pull origin main
Merge the feature branch:
git merge feature-branch
Push the updated main branch to GitHub:
git push origin main
Delete the feature branch if no longer needed:
git branch -d feature-branch
31. Merge Without Fast-Forwarding
To keep a record of the branch history and avoid a fast-forward merge:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
git push origin main
--no-ff â†’ Ensures a merge commit is created even if it's a fast-forward merge.
32. Delete a Feature Branch Locally and on GitHub
Delete Locally
git branch -d feature-branch
If the branch is not fully merged, use:
git branch -D feature-branch
Delete on GitHub
git push origin --delete feature-branch

Step 1: Create a New Repository
Go to GitHub.
Click on your profile icon and select Your repositories.
Click New.
Provide a repository name, description, and choose Public or Private.

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with README and .gitignore"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
git push -u origin main
35. Create a Repository, Add a License, and Enable Branch Protection
Step 1: Create the Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
Check Add a README file.
Select a license under Add a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
Step 2: Clone Locally and Push Initial Files
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
echo "# Project Name" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with license"
git push origin main
Step 3: Enable Branch Protection
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click Settings â†’ Branches.
Under Branch Protection Rules, select Add rule.
Choose main as the protected branch.
Enable:

After collaborating with a colleague, you notice they pushed changes to GitHub.
How would you pull those updates into your local repository without losing your
work?
38.You and a teammate are working on the same project. Theyâ€™ve pushed some
changes. How would you pull those changes into your local branch and handle
merge conflicts if they arise?
39.Youâ€™re working on a feature, and your teammate pushed updates to the main
branch. How would you pull those changes into your current branch without
conflicts?
ChatGPT said:
37. Pull Updates Without Losing Your Work
If your colleague has pushed changes to GitHub and you want to pull them into your local repository without losing your work:

Step 1: Commit Your Changes (If Any)
Before pulling, ensure your local changes are saved:

git add .
git commit -m "Saving local changes before pulling updates"
Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes
git pull origin main
If there are no conflicts, Git will merge the changes automatically.

Step 3: If You Have Uncommitted Changes
If you havenâ€™t committed your changes and want to pull updates:

git stash  # Saves your local changes temporarily
git pull origin main  # Pulls the latest changes
git stash pop  # Restores your saved changes
38. Pull Changes and Handle Merge Conflicts
If your teammate has pushed changes, follow these steps:

Step 1: Pull Updates from GitHub
git pull origin main
If there are no conflicts, the changes will merge automatically.

Step 2: Handle Merge Conflicts (If Any)
If Git detects a conflict, it will show a message like:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>
To resolve:

Open the conflicting file and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Manually edit the file to keep the correct changes.
Once resolved, run:
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <filename>"
git push origin main
39. Pull Main Branch Updates into Your Feature Branch Without Conflicts
If youâ€™re working on a feature branch and need to integrate the latest main branch updates:

Step 1: Switch to Your Feature Branch
git checkout feature-branch
Step 2: Fetch and Merge main into Your Branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
If there are no conflicts, Git will merge automatically.

Step 3: Handle Conflicts (If Any)
If conflicts appear, resolve them as mentioned in Step 2 of question 38.

Alternative: Rebase Instead of Merge
If you want a cleaner commit history, use:

git rebase main
This reapplies your commits on top of the latest main. If conflicts arise, resolve them and continue rebasing:

git add .
git rebase --continue
